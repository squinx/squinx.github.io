"Two of <b>Judy Hoaglund's</b>¬†great gifts as a teacher are her kindness and her capacity to listen without judgement. She is incredibly knowledgable about the Pachakuti Mesa Tradition, the Quechua language, the shamanic modalities and the two lineages of this tradition. Study with Judy; You're whole life will change for the shining, empowered better!"

"<strong>Thomas Mock</strong> emanates an integration of the Mesa from his own being consistent with the Four Directions, holding sacred space for all, discerning the detail of the heart work needed, and evoking Spirit so that apprentices may integrate the Mesa into their own Lifeway. Thomas builds ceremony based in love and acceptance, where past wounds and vulnerabilities may be approached in safety and as a natural part of the Journey, setting the space for healers to heal what is within as a necessary step to healing work conducted for the Greater Good."

‚ÄúI wanted to leave a review on Robin‚Äôs classes. I have been in session where <strong>Robin (Harman</strong>) was a co-leader and sessions where she is the only teacher. She is a wonderful teacher. Very knowledgeable in her subject matter and thorough. She has a plan for the general direction of the workshop and the skills she would like for us to learn. Robin provides both written materials and skills training for her students. She is an honest, compassionate and knowledgeable leader. I would take any class offered by her.‚Äù
<em>Christie Burcher, Atlanta, GA, May 2016</em>

My participation in the Pachakuti trainings with <strong>Tom Mock</strong> was wonder-filled. Tom brings profound knowledge and open-hearted kindness to everything he does. He is able to create a spiritual space that is inclusive of any cross cultural shamanic path a student may be pursuing.¬† Tom is able to weave these understandings into the greater matrix of the tradition in a respectful and a heartfelt way. Tom is able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù what needs doing and he is able to share this perspective with his students. He is a fabulous guide for the Pachakuti path.

‚ÄúMy time with <strong>Gary Langston and Carol Rydel</strong> was beyond any expectation I had of being in sacred space with them, and the teachings of this module. The wisdom of the ‚Äútiming‚Äù‚Äù from HanaqPacha and the Apukunas messages and Gary‚Äôs allowing of the flowing of blessings being shown to us from the ‚Äúunseen realms‚Äù, provided an exquisite weaving into our time together. ¬†Stepping beyond the intended itinerary for ‚ÄúCondor‚Äôs Quest-Creating the Future‚Äù we were able to be in service the community at large and experience the ‚ÄúFive Virtues of the Mesa‚Äù in real time! ¬†Gary and Carol‚Äôs adept ability as instructors, their sacred relationship with the encantos, calicantos, the mesa, the living kawsay in each moment, and their open hearts of service and love is a most beautiful expression of Ayni for this PMT tradition and our world. They are ~ Sacred Beauty Weavers!¬† Munay &amp; Sulpayki Gary and Carol! ~ Apukunaq Saminchay!‚Äù<em>

‚Äú<strong>Robin Harman</strong> creates a sacred container in her workshops that honors every participant and creates a safe space for learning and personal healing.

‚ÄúI am writing this letter to share my experiences with <strong>Catherine Kendra Davis</strong>. Kendra has been working with me for six years. She has worked on me as a myopractor, mesa healing and lympia. The mesa healing has always helped me reconnect body, mind and soul with renewed energy and peace of mind. Her approach is unique and her techniques help correct subtle energy blockages. Recently Kendra got a small group together to build an apacheta at my house on Palomar Mountain. It was truly a spiritual inspiration and a few days later we got 2 1/2 inches of rain that the dry mountain needed. Kendra is very knowledgeable and professional. Her intuitive nature, and unique combination of skills have been a blessing to my life, and I would highly recommend her to anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo say that it‚Äôs been an honor and a privilege to work with <strong>Kendra (Davis</strong>) would be understating just how much she has touched my life. Truthfully, it‚Äôs been more of a wonder and a blessing. Aside from simply being a truly loving and beautiful person, Kendra has revealed herself to be a powerful healer, with so many intrinsic intuitive gifts, that I always feel safe and supported when working with her. I feel grateful to have found a person so open in sharing her knowledge, so wholly devoted to service, and so willing and patient to teach as well! I am so thankful for this dear sister, and I look forward to more work with her as I continue along my path.‚Äù
<em>Jon DeRosa, 2016</em>

‚ÄúI have taken classes, attended ceremonies and am currently apprenticing with <strong>Kendra Davis</strong> in a group of 9 other students. Kendra has been involved in the Pachakuti Mesa Tradition (PMT) for the past 10 years, but it might as well have been 25 years because she is such a deeply devoted mesa carrier and teacher. She has amazing gifts and abilities that she shares with students and clients. After my initial session with Kendra, a limpia (clearing process), which was powerful and enlightening, I was inexplicably drawn to learning more from her and becoming a Shaman in my own right. Kendra really cares about and watches out for all of her students and is readily accessible to sit with you, answer questions and clarify any information, technique or tool you have learned or would like to learn. Her teaching is straight forward and easy follow. During her classes, apprenticeship or otherwise, she offers a myriad of experiential exercises, so you not only learn from lecture, but also through actual experience. She allows you to follow her lead, but also gives enough freedom that you can add your personal flair to what you learn. This is a wonderful part of the PMT ‚Äì the shamanism is cross-cultural and you are taught the foundation of the teachings, but then can add your personal style, sacred objects and methods. Her personal gifts of insight, intuition, clairsentience and connection to the earth and with ‚Äúthe unseen‚Äù are mind boggling and she is always willing to share and demonstrate these as well as help you to learn how to discover your own beautiful and powerful gifts. I highly recommend learning anything and everything you can from this very wise, very wonderful shaman and teacher. She is a real gem!‚Äù
